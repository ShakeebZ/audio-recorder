# audio-recorder

This system was built using the ZYNQ-7020 Zedboard. It allows for audio recording and playback alongside audio speedup and slowdown. The project block diagram can be viewed in Vivado and run in Vitis.
 
Notes:
To build the project, launch Vitis and choose to import project. Using the zipped vitis_export_archive.ide.zip file allows pathing to be built according to your system.
The project will also need the hardware specification to be updated to the local audio_recorder.xsa path as the default is preset to the computer it was created on.
